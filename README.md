This is my work from a skeleton project that I did for CSC311- Module 7. The provided skeleton code is for a registration page for adding, deleting, or editing users from a table view, which stores the data in a Microsoft Azure SQL database. To get to this table view, you need to log in through a slash screen, after which you can log out. I have currently added the ability to make a CVS file with the data as well as importing CVS files. I also made it so that you can edit elements directly by typing in the text fields instead of pressing the edit button. I also performed general error prevention and added an incomplete functionality of the user signing up.
